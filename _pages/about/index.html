I am currently a senior researcher at the big data research center in Iran working in artificial intelligence algorithms, deep learning algorithms, and data science. Moreover, I’m a manager director of the <a href="https://usern.tums.ac.ir/Group/Info/IBDAM" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">USERN-IBDAM</a> research group for developing intelligent big data analytics methods in medicine. I published many <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bpZOZWsAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">papers</a> in prestigious journals and conferences and received several awards and honors from the university, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7127866223802929153/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IFAC</a> congress, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7019722659584163840/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IEEE</a>, and inventor and innovation award. I have experience carrying out medical data management analysis and machine learning research, and completing relevant projects. I’m interested in researching toward a deeper understanding and analyzing of data and proposing effective optimizers and machine learning algorithms that can extract meaningful insights from data in various applications.</p> </body></html>
