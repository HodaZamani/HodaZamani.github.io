I earned my Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics with summa cum laude distinction. Since then, my work has gained global recognition, and in 2024, I was honored as one of the top 2% scientists worldwide in artificial intelligence and image processing by Elsevier and Stanford University. I am currently a senior researcher at the Big Data Research Center, focusing on AI algorithms, deep learning, and data science for medical applications, and I have conducted extensive research in medical data management, advanced AI models, and the development of innovative optimizers. My research has been published in numerous prestigious journals, with some recognized as Highly Cited and Hot Papers by Web of Science. These achievements have earned me awards and recognition, including the Best Quantum Theory Paper Award from IFAC for three consecutive years, an Outstanding Ph.D. Thesis Award from IEEE, and the Best Innovator Award from the Invention Festival. In addition, I actively contribute as a volunteer reviewer for high-impact journals, including Elsevier, Springer, and other leading international publications.
