I graduated with a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics with summa cum laude level in September 2020. I am currently a senior researcher at the big data research center in Iran working in artificial intelligence algorithms, deep learning algorithms, and data science. Moreover, Iâ€™m a manager director of the [USERN-IBDAM](https://usern.tums.ac.ir/Group/Info/IBDAM) research group for developing intelligent big data analytics methods in medicine. I published many [papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bpZOZWsAAAAJ&hl=en) in prestigious journals and conferences and received several awards and honors from the university, [IFAC](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7127866223802929153/) congress, [IEEE](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7019722659584163840/), and inventor and innovation award. I have experience carrying out medical data management analysis and machine learning research, and completing relevant projects. I'm interested in researching toward a deeper understanding and analyzing of data and proposing effective optimizers and machine learning algorithms that can extract meaningful insights from data in various applications.
