## Abstract
Medical datasets are mainly composed of countless irrelevant and redundant features in a series of patient records. All these features are not required to obtain a medical decisionmaking process. On the other hand, the huge size of data is caused to increase the dimensionality and to reduce the performance of classifier. Recently, there have been many methods proposed to solve this problem and their results show that the feature selection can be an effective solution. The feature selection methods are mostly aim to reduce the size of data and enhance the efficiency of learning algorithms by eliminating the unrelated and redundant features. In this paper, a meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed named FSWOA for feature selection. This algorithm is based on the hunting methods of Humpback Whales consisting of three main steps: encircling prey, spiral bubble-net attacking and search for prey. The performance of proposed algorithm is evaluated conducted by four standard medical datasets: Pima Indians Diabetes, Original Wisconsin Breast Cancer, Statlog and Hepatitis. The results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the dimensionality of medical datasets with acceptable accuracy for diseases diagnosis.
