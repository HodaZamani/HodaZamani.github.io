## Abstract
There are many constraints in solving the engineering optimization problems, through which finding a feasible solution is a challenging task. Although researchers have proposed some effective algorithms to cope with this challenge, most of their proposed algorithms suffer from the low diversity of the population and trapped by the local optima. In this paper, an enhancement of the bernstain-search differential evolution algorithm named EBSD is developed to solve the constrained engineering problems. In the EBSD, the trial pattern vector is improved, and the Chebyshev chaotic map is used to increase the diversity of the population. The EBSD algorithm is evaluated by four constrained engineering design problems, including pressure vessel, welded beam, tension/compression spring, and three-bar truss. In all experiments, EBSD is compared by the state-of-the-art swarm intelligence algorithms: CLPSO, DE/BBO, EEGWO, WDE, ChOA, and BSD. The experimental results show that the EBSD algorithm is very competitive compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms to solve these constrained engineering problems.
