<p align="justify"><b>Importance:</b> Medicine consumption strains the economy, as it takes up a big part of health and GDP spending. In 2022, the OECD average health-to-GDP ratio was 9.2%. The UK's ratio was 10.3% and Iran's was 6.5%, indicating that the UK spent more on health relative to its economic output than Iran. By 2027, global medicine spending will reach $1.9 trillion, up from $1.48 trillion in 2022, driven by factors such as population growth, aging, disease burden, and innovation. The USA will spend 40% of that, the UK 3.5%, and Iran 0.4%, reflecting the differences in their income levels, health systems, and medicine prices. These trends suggest that medicine consumption will continue to pose significant challenges and opportunities for health policy and economic development in the coming years.</p>

<p align="justify">My family pharmacy app is a powerful tool that is developed based on a cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) within six steps: problem understanding, image data understanding, data pre-processing, data processing, data post-processing, and development. This app can evaluate and extract valuable knowledge from various types of data, such as images and sound for different medical tasks: diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and patient management. Also, these data are collected to help researchers in different domains.

<p align="justify">My family pharmacy app, as a computational process including algorithms at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and databases, deals with a large volume of drug images. The purpose of my family pharmacy app is to find knowledge from drug images, which is expressed in a comprehensible structure using the proposed machine learning algorithm to determine valuable preterm and classify the drug based on disease.</p>
