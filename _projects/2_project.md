<p align="justify">Drug consumption is a major economic burden for the country every year. By managing the medication stock at home, we can reduce this huge cost. We developed my family pharmacy app to help people with the following objectives:</p>
<p align="justify">•  To monitor and track their medication intake and expiry dates</p>
<p align="justify">•  To order and refill prescriptions online from trusted pharmacies</p>
<p align="justify">•  To access personalized health tips and reminders based on their medical conditions</p>
<p align="justify">•  To connect with doctors and pharmacists for consultations and advice</p>
<p align="justify">•  To share their medication history and records with their family and caregivers</p>
<p align="justify">My pharmacy app is a smart and convenient solution for managing your health and wellness. It uses deep learning algorithms to analyze your data and provide you with the best recommendations. It also ensures your privacy and security by encrypting your information and storing it on a secure cloud.</p>

<p align="justify">The app is headed by <b>professor Mohammad H. Nadimi-Shahraki</b> as the principal investigator and <b>Hoda Zamani</b> as the co-principal investigator.</p>

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

<p align="justify">My family pharmacy app is a powerful tool that is developed based on a cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM) within six steps: problem understanding, image data understanding, data pre-processing, data processing, data post-processing, and development. This app can evaluate and extract valuable knowledge from various types of data, such as images and sound for different medical tasks: diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and patient management. Also, these data are collected to help researchers in different domains.

<p align="justify">My family pharmacy app, as a computational process including algorithms at the intersection of machine learning, statistics, and databases, deals with a large volume of drug images. The purpose of my family pharmacy app is to find knowledge from drug images, which is expressed in a comprehensible structure using the proposed machine learning algorithm to determine valuable preterm and classify the drug based on disease.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/MobilApp.jpeg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:


{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
