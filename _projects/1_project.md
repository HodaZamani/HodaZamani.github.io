    Title of Funded Project: Type2 Diabetes Detection
    Number: A2017A1-240
    Date of Agreement: 2017/5/12
    Principal Investigator: Professor Mohammad H. Nadimi-Shahraki
    Co-principal Investigator: Hoda Zamani

    Submitted Grant Proposal to the Big Data Research Center Foundation
   



<p align="justify">The World Health Organization reported that the number of people with diabetes increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. Iran ranks 14th in the world for type 2 diabetes prevalence among adults aged 20-79 and faces various complications, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, eye disease, nerve damage, and foot problems. Additionally, type 2 diabetes can increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. To address this issue, we developed a model to provide a low-cost and early diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. We aim to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes-related complications and improve the quality of life of millions of Iranians. This project is planned  in four phases.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Data acquisition phase</b> involves collecting relevant health information from the target population using various methods such as surveys, blood tests, and wearable devices. Two diabetologist consultants supervise this phase. The <b>data preprocessing phase</b> is crucial for preparing the data for the diagnosis model to involve cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data using statistical and machine learning techniques. In the <b>data modeling phase</b>, we develop and validate diagnosis models that can accurately diagnose type 2 diabetes based on the data. In the final phase, we <b>develop a mobile app</b> that can provide personalized feedback and recommendations to users based on their risk level and health status. The project hopes to contribute to the global efforts to combat type 2 diabetes, which is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world.</p>

<p align="justify">We have created a mobile app for type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition affecting how the body uses glucose as energy. Our app can help users monitor their blood glucose levels, track their diet and exercise, set medication reminders, and receive personalized feedback and tips. Our app is based on the latest scientific research and best practices for diabetes management. Our app is compatible with various devices and platforms and syncs with other health apps and devices. Our app empowers users to take charge of their health and well-being.

<p align="justify">Our project dataset contains medical and demographic information from the targeted Najafabad Population, which we used to develop and test our diagnosis model. You can access our dataset at the <a href="https://hodazamani.github.io/repositories">repository</a>.</p>
