    Title of Funded Project: A Low-cost Early Detection of Type 2 Diabetes
    Number: A2017A1-240
    Date of Agreement: 2017/5/12
    Principal Investigator: Professor Mohammad H. Nadimi-Shahraki
    Co-principal Investigator: Hoda Zamani 

   
<p align="justify"><b>Importance:</b> This project aims to address a major global health challenge: diabetes. This chronic disease affects more than 400 million people worldwide, and its prevalence is increasing rapidly. <b>Iran</b> has one of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes among adults aged 20-79, ranking <b>14th</b> in the world. Type 2 diabetes causes various health complications in Iran, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, eye disease, nerve damage, foot problems, and even pancreatic cancer. These complications impair the quality of life and increase the risk of mortality for millions of people in Iran.

<p align="justify"><b>Objective:</b> The objective of this project is to develop a low-cost and early diagnosis model for type 2 diabetes, which affects millions of Iranians and causes various health complications. By achieving this objective, we aim to enhance the quality of life of the affected population and prevent or reduce the severity of diabetes-related complications. We plan to disseminate the findings of this project and model to some countries with a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes and its complications, as they could benefit from our low-cost and early diagnosis approach.
<b>This project consisted of four phases.</b>

<p align="justify"><b>Data acquisition phase</b> involves collecting relevant health information from the target population using various methods such as surveys, blood tests, and wearable devices. Two diabetologist consultants supervise this phase. The <b>data preprocessing phase</b> is crucial for preparing the data for the diagnosis model to involve cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data using statistical and machine learning techniques. In the <b>data modeling phase</b>, we develop and validate diagnosis models that can accurately diagnose type 2 diabetes based on the data. In the final phase, we <b>develop a mobile app</b> that can provide personalized feedback and recommendations to users based on their risk level and health status. The project hopes to contribute to the global efforts to combat type 2 diabetes, which is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world.</p>

<p align="justify">We have created a mobile app for type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition affecting how the body uses glucose as energy. Our app can help users monitor their blood glucose levels, track their diet and exercise, set medication reminders, and receive personalized feedback and tips. Our app is based on the latest scientific research and best practices for diabetes management. Our app is compatible with various devices and platforms and syncs with other health apps and devices. Our app empowers users to take charge of their health and well-being.

<p align="justify">Our project dataset contains medical and demographic information from the targeted Najafabad Population, which we used to develop and test our diagnosis model. You can access our dataset at the <a href="https://hodazamani.github.io/repositories">repository</a>.</p> Some of the findings of this project were published in a paper that is cited at the end of this web page.
