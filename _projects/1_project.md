    Title of Funded Project: A Low-cost Early Detection of Type 2 Diabetes

<p align="justify"><b>Importance:</b> Type 2 diabetes is a serious condition that can lead to complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, and amputation. This chronic disease affects more than 400 million people worldwide, and its prevalence has rapidly increased and doubled in the last 15 years, which has challenged many countries' healthcare systems. Fortunately, there have been proposed methods for early detection, which can prevent or delay it by adopting a healthy lifestyle, such as eating well, moving more, and losing weight if needed. However, current methods of diagnosis, such as blood tests, are often invasive, costly, and time-consuming. Moreover, many people may not have access to adequate healthcare facilities or awareness of their risk status. Iran has one of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes among adults aged 20-79, ranking 14th in the world. Therefore, developing an intelligent mobile app that people can use for low-cost early detection of type 2 diabetes is crucial.

<p align="justify"><b>Objective:</b> This project aims to develop an intelligent mobile app that people can use for low-cost early detection of type 2 diabetes since Iran has one of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes among adults aged 20-79, ranking 14th in the world. This mobile app can be used by people quickly and help them to prevent or reduce the severity of diabetes-related complications as soon as possible. This app can be used in other countries with a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes.</p>
<b>This project consisted of four phases.</b></p>

<p align="justify"><b>Data acquisition phase</b> involves collecting relevant health information from the target population using various methods such as surveys, blood tests, and wearable devices. Two diabetologist consultants supervise this phase. The <b>data preprocessing phase</b> is crucial for preparing the data for the diagnosis model to involve cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data using statistical and machine learning techniques. In the <b>data modeling phase</b>, we develop and validate diagnosis models that can accurately diagnose type 2 diabetes based on the data. In the final phase, we <b>develop a mobile app</b> that can provide personalized feedback and recommendations to users based on their risk level and health status. The project hopes to contribute to the global efforts to combat type 2 diabetes, which is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world.</p>

<p align="justify">We have created a mobile app for type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition affecting how the body uses glucose as energy. Our app can help users monitor their blood glucose levels, track their diet and exercise, set medication reminders, and receive personalized feedback and tips. Our app is based on the latest scientific research and best practices for diabetes management. Our app is compatible with various devices and platforms and syncs with other health apps and devices. Our app empowers users to take charge of their health and well-being.

<p align="justify">Our project dataset contains medical and demographic information from the targeted Najafabad Population, which we used to develop and test our diagnosis model. You can access our dataset at the <a href="https://hodazamani.github.io/repositories">repository</a>.</p> Some of the findings of this project were published in a paper that is cited at the end of this web page.
