<p align="justify">The World Health Organization reported that the number of people with diabetes increased from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. Iran ranks 14th in the world for type 2 diabetes prevalence among adults aged 20-79 and faces various complications, such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, eye disease, nerve damage, and foot problems. Additionally, type 2 diabetes can increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. To address this issue, we developed a model to provide a low-cost and early diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. We hope to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes-related complications and improve the quality of life of millions of Iranians.</p>

<p align="justify">The project is headed by <b>professor Mohammad H. Nadimi-Shahraki</b> as the principal investigator and <b>Hoda Zamani</b> as the co-principal investigator. 
This project is planned in four main phases. 
     

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/Drawing1.jpg" title="Example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/Drawing2.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/Drawing3.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/Drawing4.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>    
</div>



<p align="justify">The <b>data acquisition phase</b> involves collecting relevant health information from the target population using various methods such as surveys, blood tests, and wearable devices. Two diabetologist consultants supervise this phase. The <b>data preprocessing phase</b> is crucial for preparing the data for the diagnosis model to involve cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the data using statistical and machine learning techniques. In the <b>data modeling phase</b>, we develop and validate diagnosis models that can accurately diagnose type 2 diabetes based on the data. In the final phase, we <b>develop a mobile app</b> that can provide personalized feedback and recommendations to users based on their risk level and health status. The project hopes to contribute to the global efforts to combat type 2 diabetes, which is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world.</p>

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
